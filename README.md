# bookbot
A CLI text file analysis application. Built alongside the Boot.dev course.

## Functionality
Upon execution, requests a filepath to a text file. The program prints to STDOUT a report listing the total number of words in the file (considered only by separation via spaces or newlines, without consideration for hyphenated breaks across newlines or misidentification of a symbol as a "word"), and a list of the alphabet characters present in the file and the number of times they occur, sorted from most to least occurrences.

## Associated Material
This project was completed as a part of the Boot.dev Backend Developer Career Path, for review of the basics as I complete my college degree. The project instructions complete after the second commit, "Added basic text analysis for hardcoded input". I added the CLI input functionality because the project didn't seem particularly functional without it.
